# Contributing to systemctl-tui

Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in contributing to `systemctl-tui`. Some guidelines:

1. Be nice. This is something I do in my spare time.
2. If you're not sure whether I'll accept a particular change, feel free to raise an issue to ask before submitting a PR.
3. Please do what you can to make PRs easy to review.
   1. In particular, explain how you've tested your change (what you did, what Linux distro, etc.) so I don't have to guess.
