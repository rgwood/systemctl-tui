A fast, simple TUI for interacting with [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) services and their logs.

`systemctl-tui` can quickly browse service status and logs, start/stop/restart/reload services, and view/edit unit files. It aims to do a small number of things well.

## Install

Note: this project only works on Linux (WSL works _if_ you [have systemd enabled](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/)). Binaries are published for x64 and ARM64 in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rgwood/systemctl-tui/releases), and [distro packages](#distro-packages) are available.

### Binary Release

Automated install/update (don't forget to always verify what you're piping into bash):

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgwood/systemctl-tui/master/install.sh | bash
```
The script installs the downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` by default, but it can be changed by setting the `DIR` environment variable.

### Rust

If you'd rather build from scratch you will need [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs/). Then either:

1. Run `cargo install systemctl-tui --locked`
2. Clone the repo and run `cargo build --release` to get a release binary at `target/release/systemctl-tui`
